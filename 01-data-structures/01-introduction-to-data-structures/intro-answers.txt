Line:

Developers can use the array data structure implemented by the Line class.  The Line class has multiple
methods that allow the developer to manipulate and access certain parts of the array that holds the members of the line.
An example of another real-world representation that could use the same data structure as the Line class would be
an online store handling which shipments should go out first based on the order in which they were received.

Screen:

Developers can use the object/array data structure implemented by the Screen class.  The Screen class allows
you to look up which pixel contains the values of certain (x,y) coordinates through a simple key lookup
based off a value in the matrix object. An example of another real-world representation that could use the same
data structure as the Screen class would be a library where each book title could be represented as a key in an
object with two values of Author and Date.
  Example:
  Library = {}
  Library["The Grapes of Wrath"] = ["John Steinbeck", "1939"]
