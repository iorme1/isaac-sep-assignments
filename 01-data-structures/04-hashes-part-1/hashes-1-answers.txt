When the computer accesses memory, it grabs a local chunk and caches it for faster access. That chunk
works well for arrays because they are stored next to each other in memory and that chunk will include a large
portion of the array data.. However, if the array continues to double when a collision occurs, the new values that get inserted
into the array can become further and further apart(fragmented) and therefore more and more likely that the computer grabs less
and less information from that array when it grabs a chunk of it.  This causes the computer to do more RAM lookups which are
very slow.
