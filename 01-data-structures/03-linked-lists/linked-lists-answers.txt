1.  When a computer accesses memory, it takes a chunk of it and loads it in the cache. When dealing with arrays,
the memory used to store the array will be connected and next to each other.  Therefore, when the computer grabs a chunk
of the array data from RAM, the cache will hold a large portion of this information held in the array.  Getting information from RAM
is a slow process whereas getting the data from the cache is quicker.  With linked lists, the memory used to store that information
will be scattered and in unrelated areas.  Therefore, when the computer grabs a chunk of memory from RAM and stores it in the cache, it is
less likely that it will contain much of the linked lists data, which causes the computer to have to retrieve
memory again from RAM which is a slow process.
